# Team-Niner-Inc
Capstone Project for Fullstack Academy Cybersecurity Bootcamp (Fettuccine)

## Summary
Broken Access Control has been ranked as the number one OWASP Top 10 security risk and the goal of this project is to reduce unauthorized access to information. I created a python script that uses a GUI to gather information about an employee and generate a summary of accesses granted based off the department and scope of their job.

### Python
This project starts with the python script [AccessCtrl.pyw](https://github.com/njnelso/Team-Niner-Inc/blob/main/AccessCtrl.pyw)

Using PySimpleGUI, we built a GUI with User Inputs and dropdown menus to fill out an employee's information.
